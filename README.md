This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template with [Devextreme](https://js.devexpress.com/React/Documentation) components.

This Application Template was built using the same (but modified) components that Devextreme uses for their [React Application Template](https://js.devexpress.com/React/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Application_Template/). It uses the default Outer Toolbar and includes a boiler plate
for NextAuth so that you can use social logins, a very popular web authentication mechanism. Since NextJS is a full stack framework you can prevent pages
from being accessed from the server if a user does not log in, and commented code is included to show you how easy it is to do this.

All of the Devextreme React widgets run on the client, including the navigation Drawer and the Toolbar, so the approach is somewhat tailor made for NextJS using dynamic pages. However you still get the benefits of NextJS with the ability to add metadata to server pages, and NextAuth runs on the server.

If you find this template useful please add a star to this page, and if you are feeling generous I always appreciate a [Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/kx3rilmbv4)
