Commands listed below are used to re-generate the base theme and additional swatch that comes with this template.  
If you prefer to use a GUI and wizard you can always use the one available at https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/

directory: NEXTJS-TEMPLATE

The following first two commands will re-generate two css files based on the information in the input files:

npx devextreme-cli build-theme  --input-file="./themes/metadata.base.json"  --output-file="./themes/generated/theme.base.css"
npx devextreme-cli build-theme  --input-file="./themes/metadata.additional.json"  --output-file="./themes/generated/theme.additional.css"

The second two commands below will regenerate two separate scss variable files which can be imported into any of the component scss files so that you can
re-use variables like $base-accent in different components. Useful if you want to change the base theme or swatches and you dont want to touch the various 
scss files (for each component) in your application.

npx devextreme-cli export-theme-vars --base-theme="fluent.blue.light"  --base --output-file="./themes/generated/variables.base.scss"
npx devextreme-cli export-theme-vars --base-theme="fluent.blue.dark"  --base --output-file="./themes/generated/variables.additional.scss"

documentation: https://js.devexpress.com/React/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_CLI/#ThemeBuilder/Command-Line_Arguments

If you want to replace the base theme (fluent.blue.light and fluent.blue.dark) simply modify the baseTheme value in both the 'metadata.base.json' 
and the 'metadata.additional.json' files.

Then replace the --base-theme values with the new ones you selected in the last two commands above (ie: --base-theme-value= "material.blue.light"), 
and then regenerate all the necessary files in /themes/generated by running the 4 commands above.

Its best to use a light theme for the base and the corresponding dark theme for the additional swatch so that the navigation menu looks nice.
Feel free to automate this if you like in a script, but I prefer to explain whats happening step-by-step so that you can customize what you want first
and then automate afterwards.
